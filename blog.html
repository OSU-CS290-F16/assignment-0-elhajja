		<h1><strong>Welcome to my blog!</strong></h1> 
		<p><h2>Entry 0 9/24/2016</h2></p>
		<p>Today was an eventful day of web development. I learned a lot about how to use images in an html document, formating lists, as well as using header tags. This didn't come as easy as expected. The biggest error I encountered was neglecting to include the = sign after src. </p>
		<p>There were some websites used to help me understand CSS: first was <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a> and the second was <a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com">htmlgoodies</a> . w3Schools was benificial because it showed me syntax with some explanation, htmlgoodies was similar but it also gave detailed information about the different types of image storage, such as jpeg,png, and gif. </p>
